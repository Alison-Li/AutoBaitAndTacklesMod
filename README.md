# Auto Bait And Tackles Mod

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/). If the current tool selected by the player is a fishing rod, the mod should automatically attach the first instance(s) of fishing bait and/or a tackle to the rod if those slots for bait and/or tackles in the rod are empty.

## Motivation

The automataic bait attachment is an extra but the main motivation was regarding the fishing tackles in Stardew Valley. This saves the player from the tediousness of having to go back in their inventory to attach new a tackle every time their currently attached tackle wears out.

## Instructions

When the fishing rod is selected, press the `R` key on your keyboard to reload the first instance of a type of fishing bait and/or fishing tackle in your backpack. Works best when you have the types of bait and tackles set in your inventory slots in the order that you want them to be attached in.
